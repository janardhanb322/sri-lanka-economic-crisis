<mark>What were the factors that triggered the Sri Lankan Economic Crisis</mark>
<li>
    Some of the factors that triggered the economic crisis in Sri Lanka were:

     <li>The Covid-19 Pandemic put the tourism industry on hold. It accounted for 10% of Sri Lanka’s GDP.
        This led to a dip in the forex reserve (from $7.5 billion in 2019 to $2.8 billion in July 2021).</li>
     <li>A dip in other sources of revenue led to high costs in importing of essential items, including food.</li>
     <li>A dip in other sources of revenue led to high costs in importing of essential items, including food.</li>
     <li>A depreciated currency, high dependence on imports and hoarding led to a steep rise in food prices in Sri Lanka.</li>
     <li>The Hambantota port was another white elephant project by the present government to shorten its economic woes. 
        Instead it only further increased the debt problem that Sri Lanka faced as it had taken $1 billion from China.</li>
     <li>The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian Conflict also is a factor which is affecting the already precarious economic condition of Sri Lanka.</li>
     <li>The reason is that Sri Lankan tourism relies on arrivals from Russia and Ukraine.</li>
     <li>Russia is also the second biggest market to Sri Lanka when it comes to tea 
        Thus, the war in Ukraine put a serious dent in the path of the economic recovery of Sri Lanka.</li>

<center><mark>CONCLUSIONS</mark></center>
<p align="justify">The government of Lanka should take steps for the economic recovery of the whole country
    once the scarcity of certain basic commodities comes to an end. The government must also
    cooperate with Tamil political leadership to establish a roadmap for economic growth in the
    civil war-impacted eastern and northern regions, between areas severely struck by the ongoing
    crisis. It would be better to increase domestic tax revenues and reduce government spending to
    restrict borrowing, especially sovereign borrowing from foreign sources. Strict measures must
    be taken for restructuring the administration of grants and subsidies. India’s Aid: It would be
    entirely inappropriate for India to allow the Chinese to take control over the growing portions
    of Sri Lankan land. India should offer Sri Lanka financial assistance, policy recommendations
    and investment from Indian entrepreneurs. Indian companies must build supply chains which
    connect the Indian as well as Sri Lankan economies with goods and services including the
    export of tea to Information technology services. India, instead of any other country, must help
    guide Sri Lanka on the path to achieving its potential to reaping the benefits of a stable
    neighborhood. The Lankan authorities must ensure that the current crisis will not be used to
    intensify smuggling activities as well as trafficking or stir up emotions in the country. Crisis as
    an Opportunity: Both Sri Lanka and India cannot have strained relations. As a much larger
    +country, the responsibility is on India. It must be very patient and engage Sri Lanka even
    further periodically and closely. Further, it is important to enhance people centric development
    activities while carefully staying away from any interference in Lanka's internal affairs. As a
    consequence of the economic crisis, Sri Lanka is keen to put in place major financial and
    regulatory reform measures. These reforms will reduce the chances of a future crisis and will
    mitigate the impact of whatever crisis will occur and is deserving of people's full support. Sri
    Lanka's government should take the above mentioned steps for the economic recovery of the
    whole country. It hopes the foreign exchange situation will improve early with the realization
    of the planned inflows from bilateral partners, and debtless creating foreign exchange inflows
    in the future. It is anticipated foreign exchange revenues from the tourism industry and
    remittances will be improved in the near future. It is expected that the people of Lanka will feel
    economic relief in the foreseeable future.s</p>

    <mark>This crisis in Sri Lanka has many lessons for countries across the globe as well as personal
        finance management lessons for individuals. Some of the key lessons for the world are
        highlighted below.</mark>
<ol TYPE="1">
     <li>Perils of free stuff politics</li>
<p align="justify">A country’s revenue is its lifeline and needs to be always protected. Any government policy
   that is detrimental to the revenue of the country which may seem lucrative for the short term 
   will always damage the economy in the long run. The Sri Lankan Government’s declaration to
   reduce taxes just to get votes and enjoy staying in power was devastating for the economy. It
   is important to understand that the system of providing free stuff in politics is not sustainable
   and will endanger the survival of the country in the future which was the case with Sri Lanka. </p> 
     <LI>Perils of dynastic politics </LI>
<P align="justify">The Rajapaksa family was the first family of the island nation and at its peak enjoyed
    approximately 75% control of the country’s budget. The saying ‘Power tends to corrupt;
    absolute power corrupts absolutely’ is quite true. The Rajakapsas belong to the majority
    community of the country and were single-handedly responsible for destroying the country’s
    economy.
    The citizens of the country are also at fault as they ignored the corruption charges against the
    family and were elected again in office in the name of majoritarian politics. We have time and
    again seen the perils of dynastic politics in many nations when incompetent people have gained
    huge power and manipulated it for their personal gains. India has also seen dynastic politics
    and its side-effects in its history and it is important that we learn from their mistakes.</P>
     <li> Do not lose focus on the key sector or industries of the economy</li>
<p align="justify">Tourism and agriculture were the key sectors in Sri Lanka and formed a major part of the GDP.
    The unpredictable circumstances like covid, the ongoing war, and the Easter bombings gave a
    series of blows to the tourism industry in the country.
    On the other hand, mismanagement and incompetent decisions of the government killed its
    agricultural sector. The key takeaway from these combined disasters is that a country should
    never lose focus on its core revenue sources and have a good stronghold on them. The
    government policies should also be with a long-term view and after taking into account the
    recommendations and warnings of experts in relevant fields to ensure that they do not backfire and bring the country to its knees. </p>
     <li>Being cautious of Chinese investments</li>
<p align="justify">China has made major investments across the globe in the name of building economies and
    helping them come on a fast track for growth. However, it is important to beware of the Chinese
    debt trap which no longer is a myth. Experts believe that China is known to invest in
    strategically important but economically poor countries and when they are unable to repay their
    debt, China is known to show its cards. The world needs to take this issue seriously and come
    together to help such countries so they do not fall into any Chinese debt trap. </p>

        <li>Sri Lanka has not experienced this extreme economic crisis in the past which makes it
            impossible to compare the present economic crisis</li>

            government of Sri Lanka has taken any appropriate steps to get rid of Sri Lanka's
